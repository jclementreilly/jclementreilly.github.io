				<div>
				<p>Much to my mother's surprise, my childhood mascara paintings on her bathroom sink and the green crayon designs on the wall were a sign of great things to come â€” I am a natural born creative. After receiving my Bachelor of Science from the Newhouse School of Communications at Syracuse University, I began my career with IBM Design. Combining my passion for art, communication and psychology, I put users at the forefront of everything I create and craft visual stories.

Whenever I am not designing, you can find me rooting for all the Boston sports teams despite where I am in the country, cooking a new recipe to later share on my food blog, going for a run trying to train for that half-marathon, and using my voice to advocate for the social justice causes I believe in (see my work with The Girl Code Movement). If you'd like to get in touch, I coded a contact form that will let you drop a line.</p>

			<h1 style="display:none;">Remembrance Scholarship</h1>
			<p> One of the greatest honors I have ever been a part of is the Remembrance Program during my undergrad at Syracuse University. In 1988, thirty-five Syracuse students out of 270 were killed in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. Each year, 35 Remembrance Scholarships are awarded to senior undergraduate students on the basis of distinguished academic achievement, citizenship, and service to community. Scholars organize events for Remembrance Week in October and carry on the legacy of those who lost their lives. I look back and act forward in memory of Julianne F. Kelly, a woman whom I hope to one day name my daughter after.</p><br>
